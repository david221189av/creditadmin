## Breadcrumbs

![Admin Architect - Breadcrumbs](http://docs.adminarchitect.com/images/index/breadcrumbs.jpg)

To build breadcrumbs Admin Architect uses [Laravel Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs) package.

Please checkout its documentation if you have any questions.

As like as Template you are free to change the way how breadcrumbs are rendered by replacing default Breadcrumbs instance by your own:

```bash
php artisan administrator:breadcrumbs Users
```
